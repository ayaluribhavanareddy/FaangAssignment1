"Hi, I’m Bhavana Reddy Ayaluri, a final-year B.Tech student with a passion for software development and data analysis. I have experience in Java, Python, MySQL, MongoDB, and JavaScript, and I’ve built full-stack applications using Node.js and Express.js. I’ve worked on projects like 'Kisan Mithra' (a web platform for farmers) and 'Drone Patrolling System for Women Safety.' I am also an event organizer and the Lead of the InfoMAC Community at my college. I’m eager to apply my skills in a challenging role and continuously learn new technologies."
